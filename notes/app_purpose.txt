    -Lesson plans:
        Come up with a real basic lesson plan.  Maybe start from the vowels,
            both hira and kata at once, and then go by consonant.  Or maybe
            learn kata and hira separately?  Research.
    
    -Save profiles.
        Basic stuff.  Should allow the user more options to select kana
            groupings for testing.  Will also enable continuing the linear
            lesson plan.
        -Record what has been "learned" as individual kana, or as groups?
            Leaning towards: group by consonants and none of the kana are
            learned unless the entire group is learned (ka, ku, ke, ki, ko).

            -Random selection of learned kana, of specified length.
